This is a little program I started working on for a friend's stream with challenge cards for different days of the month. Depending on the day you click, a chatbox will pop up and then a chathead will be placed over that number to show it's been opened.

There is logic that stops you from opening days in the future as well. I wasn't given all of the cards for the final project, but I did upload what I had before the event went live.
